## License

## Features
- Deployed server through Heroku
- Save and delete notes from the database file on click
- Recall notes from the database on click

## Tests
In the terminal, the command `npm start` was run which deploys a local server. Opening the local host server in a browser, the notes button links to the note taking page. On the note taking page, the buttons for new notes, save notes, recalling notes, and delete notes buttons all perform a respective task. When viewing the db.json file in the db.json folder, it contains an array of all the notes the user has input without any notes that user has deleted.
